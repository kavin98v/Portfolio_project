        I'm a tech enthusiast with a strong focus on frontend development and
        UI/UX design. I build responsive, user-centered web interfaces using
        React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and TailwindCSS, always aiming for clean
        code and smooth performance. My design process is powered by Figma and
        Photoshop, where I love translating ideas into functional and beautiful
        user experiences. I’m also familiar with Java and MySQL, giving me a
        solid foundation in backend logic and databases. Beyond the technical
        side, I thrive in collaborative environments, bringing strong
        communication, creative thinking, and a problem-solving mindset to every
        project. I’m constantly exploring new technologies and design trends —
        because in this field, there’s always something exciting to learn.
